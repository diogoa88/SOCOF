Assessment Exercise 2: Concurrency with synchronous messages in ADA

Concurrency with synchronous messages

A flooding detection system is made of a set of sensors caple of detecting water and a central coordination system. Create an ADA program that simulates sensors and a central coordinator as described next:

.Tasks to implement sensors that can be queried and return if they detect water (or not).
.A central task that queries sensors in periods of 5 seconds and is able to detect both if water was detected and if there is a sensor malfunction (not answering queries).
.Communication between tasks using rendezvous.

Submission deadline: 9th of June 2019
